#PROJECT NAME 

#finance_calculators

# GENERAL INFORMATION:

# This program allows the user to access two different calculations. An investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.
# The program start out by asking the user to input his/her choice - "investment" or "bond".
# if the user choose investment, the user is asked to input the amount of money he/she is depositing using the float form of input (e.g. 100.00 and not 100).
# In addition the user is asked to input the interest rate and the years he/she is planning to invest - only the number must be inputted for both these questions.
# The user must choose between simple- or compounded interest. The relevant calculation answer will then be outputed according to user input.

# if the user choose "bond", the user is asked to input the present value of the house using once again a float form of input (e.g. 100.00 and not 100).
# The user is then asked to enter the interest rate - only the number. Furthermore the user is asked to enter the amount of months for repayment.
# The answer will be output according to the formula/calculation.

# TECHNOLOGY

# The Python programming language (version 3.8.2) were used for this program along with the imported math module.
# IDE used - Eclipse (Version 2020-9(4.17.0)

# PROJECT STATUS

# Further development require making this code a functional Graphical User Interface (GUI)
